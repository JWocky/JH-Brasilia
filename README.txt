The Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia
============================

In 1974, the knowledge gained with the Bandeirante led Embraer to start developing a new aircraft for use in regional airlines—the pressurized turboprop EMB-120. At first, it was named Araguaia, but then the name was changed to Brasilia in 1979, at the official launching of the project.
The EMB-120, with capacity for 30 passengers, had the same “T” empennage as the Xingu and supercritical wing profile. It was the first aircraft to use the newly created 1500-HP PW115 turbines, manufactured by Pratt & Whitney, which, together with the propellers developed by Hamilton Standard, would allow the twin-engine airplane to exceed the speed of 500 km/h (310 mph). The airplane also had certain amenities, such as air conditioning during flight and low noise and vibration levels.
The official introduction and christening of the first prototype was held on July 29, 1983, when the aircraft, with polished aluminum coating and mirrored surface finishing specially manufactured by Alcoa, took its maiden flight. It was the first time the international specialized press and representatives of various airlines and manufacturers of aeronautical components from around the world followed the launching of an aircraft manufactured in Brazil with great interest. In December of that year, Embraer received from ABM (Brazilian Association of Marketing) the “Destaque de Marketing” (Marketing Highlight) award in the area of technological development because of the national and international impact it achieved by launching the Brasilia.
Production of the Brasilia started at the end of 1984, and its official approval occurred in May 1985. While the Bandeirante began its career in Brazil and then was exported later on, the Brasilia started to operate abroad from the very beginning. Even before the first delivery, it was already the best-selling plane of its class in the world. The first company to receive the Brasilia was the North American operator Atlantic Southeast Airlines, based in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1985. In September of that year, the Brasilia had taken its maiden flight in a regular operation, linking the North American cities of Gainesville, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia. The following year, the Brasilia was the first Brazilian aircraft to be granted official approval in Germany. In January 1988 the Brasilia went into service in Brazil, for the Rio-Sul airline.
In 1994 the Brasilia was considered the most widely used regional aircraft in the world: 26 companies in 14 countries formed a fleet which flew more than three million hours. It is still in operation for several national and international airlines. In 1996 the Brasilia received a special safety award, granted by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
In total, 352 Brasilia airplanes were delivered to 33 operators around the world.
